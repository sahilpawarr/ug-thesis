Shooting in association football is a critical aspect of the game, and its impact on the final scoreline has long been recognized. However, there is much more to shooting than just scoring goals. In this research paper, the author explores the potential applications of Expected Goals (xG) models for analyzing player performances for talent recruitment in football.

The author creates a binary classifier-based xG model using logistic regression, entirely coded in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib and uses historical data from Wyscout for five seasons across Europeâ€™s top 5 domestic competitions to determine the likelihood of a shot being a goal. By analyzing the characteristics of a shot, such as its location, the type of shot and the context of the game, the model calculates the probability of the shot resulting in a goal. The binary classifier allows for a more straightforward interpretation of the model's output, with each shot classified as either a goal or not a goal. 

Using the xG model, the author examines the performances of individual players and teams. The model allows for a more in-depth analysis of a player's contribution to the team, beyond just the number of goals they score. Additionally, the author demonstrates how football clubs can use the xG model for talent recruitment, identifying promising prospects who may have been overlooked by traditional scouting methods. Further the research consists of 3 real life case studies of players and clubs that showcase how the methods discussed in this thesis can be applied and validated.

Overall, this research highlights the importance of shooting in football and demonstrates the potential of data-driven analysis in the sport. This research has important implications for coaches, players, and clubs looking to improve their performance on the pitch.
